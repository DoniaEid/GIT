# 📚 Data Structure Training

Welcome to the **Data Structure Training** repository!  
This project is part of my personal learning journey and academic practice at the Faculty of Computers.

It includes practical implementations of fundamental **data structures** in **C/C++**, designed to build a strong understanding of how data is organized and manipulated in memory.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- ✅ Arrays  
- ✅ Linked Lists  
- ✅ Stacks  
- ✅ Queues  
- ✅ Trees  
- ✅ Hash Tables  

Each topic is covered with hands-on examples and clean code to help reinforce theoretical knowledge with practical experience.
